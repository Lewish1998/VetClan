<h1>VetClan</h1>
<h3>A full stack veterinary app created with Flask</h3>
<hr>

The aim for this project was to create a full stack crud app using Flask.

Features:
Creating users
Adding pets and assigning them to users
Pets are randomly allocated one of the available vets - this can be changed in the edit page
Ability to edit and delete both users and pets
View more information on a selected pet or user


I planned the basic layout of the site, what my backend relationships would be and what funcionality and features I would like to have.

This project was created using:
Flask
PSQL
HTML
CSS

Looking back at the project I would have liked to modeled it on a pre-existing site to achieve a more professional looking product.
I would also like to have had a treatments page where users would be able to book their pets at a specific date and time for one of the availably treatments.
